# Assignment 3 Typechecker
- The initial template passes void_return_empty.cc and do_nothing.cc
- The rules that are already implemented ares SExp, SDecls, and SReturn as well as EInt, ETimes, EAss, and ETyped
- The program easy_add.cc requires a typechecking rule for EPlus
- The program ass_easy.cc requires a typechecking rule for SInit and EId
> For whatever reason git will not allow me to add all the test files to this repo :( so it is best to replace my Typechecker.hs with the original repo's Typechecker.hs file then run **stack build** and **stack test**
